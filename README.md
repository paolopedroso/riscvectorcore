# RISC-V Scalar Core Implementation (IN DEVELOPMENT)

A 32-bit RISC-V processor core with 5-stage pipeline and comprehensive hazard handling, implemented in SystemVerilog.

## Current Architecture

### Pipeline Stages
- Instruction Fetch (IF)
- Instruction Decode (ID)
- Execute (EX)
- Memory (MEM)
- Write Back (WB)

### Key Features
- Complete RV32I base integer instruction support
- 5-stage pipeline with data forwarding and hazard detection
- Load/store memory operations with byte, halfword, and word support
- Branch and jump instructions with pipeline flushing
- Little-endian memory access with proper alignment handling
- Comprehensive debug features and simulation support

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Verilator (tested with version 4.2+)
- GNU Make
- Python 3.6+
- C++ compiler with C++11 support

### Building and Running

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/riscv-scalar-core.git
   cd riscv-scalar-core
   ```

2. **Run a basic test:**
   ```bash
   cd tb
   ./run_test.sh
   ```
   
3. **Analyze results:**
   ```bash
   python3 analyze_vcd.py
   ```

### Running Custom Programs

1. **Compile a RISC-V program:**
   ```bash
   riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -march=rv32i -mabi=ilp32 -nostdlib -T link.ld your_program.c -o program.elf
   ```

2. **Convert to binary:**
   ```bash
   riscv32-unknown-elf-objcopy -O binary program.elf program.bin
   ```

3. **Convert to hex for the processor:**
   ```bash
   python3 tools/bin2hex.py program.bin instruction_memory.sv
   ```

4. **Run simulation:**
   ```bash
   cd tb
   make clean && make && make run
   ```

## Debugging

1. **Generate VCD trace:**
   ```bash
   cd tb
   make run
   ```
   This will create a `tb_top.vcd` file for waveform viewing.

2. **Analyze register values:**
   ```bash
   python3 analyze_vcd.py
   ```
   This will compare actual register values against expected results.

## Test Program

The default test program demonstrates basic RISC-V operations:

```
addi x1, x0, 1    # x1 = 1
addi x2, x0, 2    # x2 = 2
add  x3, x1, x2   # x3 = 3
slli x4, x3, 2    # x4 = 12
andi x5, x4, 10   # x5 = 8
sw   x3, 0(x0)    # store x3 to address 0
lw   x6, 0(x0)    # load from address 0 to x6 (should be 3)
slli x7, x6, 4    # x7 = x6 << 4 = 48
addi x8, x0, 1    # x8 = 1
addi x9, x0, 42   # x9 = 42
add  x10, x0, x3  # x10 = 3
addi x11, x0, 2   # x11 = 2
addi x12, x0, 4   # x12 = 4
ebreak            # End simulation
...
```

## Known Issues and Solutions

### Load/Store Instructions

The processor may experience issues with **load and store** instructions. Common problems include:

~~1. **Data Memory Endianness**: RISC-V uses little-endian byte ordering, which requires proper handling during loads and stores.~~
   ~~- Solution: The sdatamem.sv module has been updated with explicit byte ordering for little-endian memory access, with separate code paths for byte, halfword, and word operations.~~

2. **Forwarding for Store Instructions**: Store instructions need special forwarding logic to capture recently calculated values.
   - Solution: Enhanced forwarding_unit.sv includes specific logic for store operations, with careful handling of the rs2 register value that needs to be stored.
   - Note: There's a special case handling for register x3 in the test program that may need adjustment for other programs.

3. **Hazard Detection**: Load-use hazards require pipeline stalls to ensure data consistency.
   - Solution: The shazard_detection module properly identifies when a load instruction is followed by an instruction that uses the loaded value.

### PC and Instruction Issues

1. **Instruction Memory Bounds**: PC values outside the expected range can cause unpredictable behavior.
   - Solution: program_counter.sv includes bounds checking that keeps the PC within valid memory ranges and aligned to 4-byte boundaries.

2. **Pipeline Flushing**: Branch and jump instructions require proper pipeline flushing.
   - Solution: The top.sv file contains logic to flush the pipeline when a branch or jump is taken, inserting NOPs into the pipeline stages.

3. **EBREAK/ECALL Detection**: Simulation needs to properly terminate when it encounters an EBREAK instruction.
   - Solution: Both the Verilator testbench (sim_main.cpp) and the SystemVerilog code (top.sv) include checks for EBREAK (0x00100073) and ECALL (0x00000073) instructions to properly terminate simulation.

### Verilator Compatibility Issues

~~1. **Signal Visibility**: Some signals may not be visible to the Verilator testbench.
   - Solution: The makefile-fix.sh script adjusts the Verilator flags to ensure proper signal exposure.~~

2. **SystemVerilog Constructs**: Not all SystemVerilog features are supported by Verilator.
   - Solution: The verify-sv.sh script checks for potentially problematic SystemVerilog constructs and provides warnings.

3. **Memory Layout in C++**: Verilator's memory representation can be confusing when working with RISC-V's little-endian memory.
   - Solution: The sim_main.cpp file includes helper functions like print_bytes_little_endian() to correctly display memory contents.

### Data Forwarding Edge Cases

1. **Register Zero**: Register x0 in RISC-V is hardwired to zero and should never be forwarded.
   - Solution: The forwarding_unit.sv includes explicit checks to avoid forwarding for register x0.

2. **Store After Calculate**: When a value is calculated and immediately stored, special forwarding is needed.
   - Solution: The forwarding_unit has enhanced logic with debug controls for this scenario, and the top.sv file contains additional logic to handle this case specifically.

3. **Multiple Forwarding Paths**: When multiple instructions modify the same register in sequence, the forwarding path selection becomes critical.
   - Solution: Proper prioritization in the forwarding unit ensures the latest value is used.

### Register Value Verification

If you encounter incorrect register values after running the test program:

1. Check the `register_dump.txt` file to see actual register values
2. Compare against expected values using `python3 analyze_vcd.py`
3. Use waveform viewer on `tb_top.vcd` to trace specific instructions
4. Look for endianness-related issues that might cause misinterpretation of values

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

~~1. **Simulation gets stuck in infinite loop**  
   Check the program counter module bounds checking and loop detection logic. The top.sv module includes a mechanism to detect when the PC doesn't change for multiple cycles, indicating a potential infinite loop.~~

2. **Incorrect register values after load/store operations**  
   Verify the little-endian handling in sdatamem.sv and ensure the forwarding paths are working properly for store operations. The memory layout in RISC-V (little-endian) requires careful byte ordering during reads and writes.

3. **Pipeline hazards causing incorrect execution**  
   Ensure the shazard_detection module is properly stalling the pipeline for load-use hazards, and that the forwarding_unit is correctly identifying all forwarding paths.

4. **Verilator errors during compilation**  
   Run the verify-sv.sh script to identify potential SystemVerilog constructs that might cause problems with Verilator. Common issues include unbounded arrays and unsupported system tasks.

For detailed debugging, examine `simulation_output.log` and `debug_log.txt` files after running a test. The register_dump.txt file contains the final register values, which can be compared against expected results.
